# Simple Scrolling Effects {#simple-usage}

TimeredCounter provides the following components for scrolling different types of data:

- [timered-counter-number](#number): `number`, `bigint`
- [timered-counter-datetime-duration](#datetime): `Date`
- [timered-counter-string](#string): `string`

You can achieve a nice scrolling effect with the default configuration.

::: tip
Click the <button class="border border-solid px-2 py-1">ðŸ”„</button> button to observe the change in values.

## Scrolling Numbers {#number}

Imagine a water meter in real life, it keeps scrolling to show the current water usage. TimeredCounter can help you achieve this effect.

## Countdown Effect {#datetime-duration}

I believe you have seen many countdowns, but most of them change abruptly without transitions. TimeredCounter can make your countdown effect smoother.

## Scrolling Strings {#string}

Have you seen the moving title on the [homepage](/)? Such an effect can make your static web page more dynamic.

::: tip
Please note that the default configuration supports a maximum of **17** characters. If you need more characters, please refer to [how to remove the character length limit](../optional-dependencies.md#how-to-remove-character-length-limit).
